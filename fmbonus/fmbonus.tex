\section{Introduction}

This is a collection of bits of mathematics relating to the Further Maths
A-level and beyond. My alternative click-bait idea for a title was ``What they
don't teach you in Further Maths A-level''. This document is often concerned
much more with proof than you would normally see at A-level, but I think this is
a very important part of mathematics (and to me, it makes maths much easier to
really agree with).

In some cases, this document may well take things way too fast. You can always
wait until you've met more things at A-level before tackling eg some of the
tricker integration questions.
