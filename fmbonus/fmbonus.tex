 \maketitle
 This is a collection of bits of mathematics relating to the Further Maths
 A-level and beyond. This document is often concerned much more with proof than
 you would normally see at A-level, but I think this is a very important part of
 mathematics (and to me, it makes maths much easier to really agree with).

 In some cases, this document may well take things way too fast. You can always
 wait until you've met more things at A-level before tackling eg some of the
 tricker integration questions.
