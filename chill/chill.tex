  \begin{itemize}
   \item
    \(S^1 = \set{z \in \C : \abs z = 1}\) is the group of complex numbers of
    modulus \(1\) under multiplication.
   \item
    For any set \(S\),
    \(\Sym(S) = \set{f\colon S \to S : \text{\(f\) is a bijection}}\) is the
    group of \emph{symmetries} or \emph{permutations} of \(S\), under
    composition.
   \item
    For any group \(G\), \(\Aut(G)\) is the group of isomorphisms from
    \(G \to G\) (``automorphisms'') under composition.
   \item
    eg \(\R^\times = (\R \setminus \set{0}, \cdot)\) is the group of nonzero
    reals under multiplication.
   \item
    eg \(\R_{>0}^\times = (\R_{>0}, \cdot)\) is the group of positive reals
    under multiplication.
   \item
    \(S_\infty = \bigcup_n S_n\) is the group of permutations of \(\N\)
    affecting only finitely many elements.
   \item
    \(A_\infty = \bigcup_n A_n\) is the group of even permutations of \(\N\)
    affecting only finitely many elements. This is a subgroup of \(S_\infty\).
   \item
    \(D_\infty = \Isom(\Z)\) is the group of isometries of \(\Z\):
    \begin{equation*}
     D_\infty
       = \set{f\colon \Z \to \Z: \forall x, y, \abs{f(x) - f(y)} = \abs{x - y}}
    \end{equation*}
   \item
    For a group \(G\) and a nonempty set \(S\), \(G^S\) is the group of
    functions from \(S\) to \(G\) under pointwise operations
    (ie \(\forall x, (f \cdot_{(G^S)} g)(x) = f(x) \cdot_G g(x)\)).
   \item
    For a nonempty set \(S\) and a collection of groups
    \(\mathcal G = \set{G_s \mid s \in S}\), \(\prod_{s \in S} G_s\) is the
    direct product of \(\mathcal G\). This is the obvious generalisation of
    direct products to possibly infinite sets.

    It can be constructed as the set of functions
    \(f: S \to \bigcup \mathcal G\) such that for all \(s \in S\),
    \(f(s) \in G_s\), under pointwise operations.

    It is possible for the \(G_s\) not to be distinct - eg
    \(\prod_{s \in S} \Z\) is perfectly well-defined.
   \item
    For a nonempty set \(S\) and a collection of groups
    \(\mathcal G = \set{G_s \mid s \in S}\), \(\bigoplus_{s \in S} G_s\) is the
    direct sum of \(\mathcal G\). This is, loosely, the set of points in the
    Cartesian product that differ from the identity only finitely often.

    It can be constructed as the subgroup of \(\prod_{s \in S} G_s\) of all
    \(f\) such that \(f(s) \ne e_{G_s}\) only finitely often.
   \item
    For a nonempty set \(S\) and a group \(G\), \({}^SG\) is the subgroup of
    \(G^S\) of all \(f: S \to G\) such that there exists some \(g \in G\) such
    that \(f(s) \ne g\) only finitely often.

    This is a definition and notation that I made up.

    We extend this definition further by defining
    \({}^SG^{(1)}\) to be the subgroup of \(G^S\) of all \(f: S \to G\) such
    that there is some \(g \in G\) such that \(f(s) \ne g\) only countably
    often.
    (Which is to say, \(\abs{\set{s \in S \mid f(s) \ne g}} < \aleph_1\),
    assuming Choice (which is true). This leads to a definition of
    \({}^SG^{(\alpha)}\) for general ordinals \(\alpha\). Then naturally,
    \({}^SG = {}^SG^{(0)}\).)
   \item
    For a nonempty set \(S\), a group \(G\), and a subgroup \(H \sgp G\), the
    \emph{Horn group} on the data \((S, G, H)\), denoted
    \({}_H^S G\), is the subgroup of \({}^S G\) of all \(f\) such that there
    exists \(h \in H\) such that \(f(s) \ne h\) only finitely often.

    The countable Horn group \({}_H^S G^{(1)}\) is the subgroup of
    \({}^S G^{(1)}\) of all \(f\) such that there exists \(h \in H\) such that
    \(f(s) \ne h\) only countably often.
   \item
    If \(R\) is a commutative unital ring, then
    \begin{itemize}
     \item
      \(\GL_n(R)\) is the group of invertible \(n \times n\) matrices
      with components in \(R\). The ``general linear group''.

      \(\GL_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \GL_n(R)\), with the natural
      inclusion, given by identifying \(M \in \GL_n(R)\) with the block matrix
      \begin{equation*}
       \begin{pmatrix}
        M & 0 \\
        0 & 1 \\
       \end{pmatrix} \in \GL_{n + 1}(R).
      \end{equation*}
      This can be thought of as matrices of infinite size, that disagree with
      the infinite identity matrix only finitely often.
     \item
      \(\SL_n(R)\) is the subgroup of \(\GL_n(R)\) of matrices
      with determinant \(1\). The ``special linear group''.

      \(\SL_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \SL_n(R)\) with the natural
      inclusion. This is isomorphic to the subgroup of
      \(\GL_\infty(R)\) of matrices with determinant \(1\), after
      noting that the determinant can lift to this union.
     \item
      \(\PGL_n(R)\) is the quotient
      \(\GL_n(R) / Z_n(R)\), where \(Z_n(R) \nsgp \GL_n(R)\) is the
      subgroup of scalar matrices
      \(Z_n(R) = \set{\lambda \mat I: \lambda \in R^\times}\).
      The ``projective general linear group''.

      % \(\PGL_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \PGL_n(R)\). The existence of this inclusion
      % is slightly more involved. Let
      % \(\phi: \GL_{n + 1}(R) \to \PGL_{n + 1}(R)\) be the quotient map, and
      % \(\rho: \GL_n(R) \to \GL_{n + 1}(R)\) be the usual top-leftwise inclusion.

      % Then \(\Ker(\phi \circ \rho) = \rho^{-1}(Z_{n + 1}(R)) \) %TODO TODO TODO
     \item
      \(\PSL_n(R) = \SL_n(R) / (Z_n(R) \cap \SL_n(R))\).
      The ``projective special linear group''.

      % \(\PSL_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \PSL_n(R)\).
     \item
      \(\O_n(R)\) is the group of matrices that are orthogonal -
      ie, such that \(\mat M \tran{\mat M} = \mat I\).
      The ``orthogonal group''.

      The fact that this is defined over any ring and not just \(\R\) is custom.

      \(\O_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \O_n(R)\), with the natural inclusion.
     \item
      \(\SO_n(R)\) is the subgroup of \(\O_n(R)\) of orthogonal matrices of
      determinant \(1\). The ``special orthogonal group''.

      \(\SO_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \SO_n(R)\), with the natural inclusion.
     \item
      \(\U(n)\) is the subgroup of \(\GL_n(\C)\) of matrices that are unitary -
      ie such that \(\mat M \herm{\mat M} = \mat I\).
      The ``unitary group''. (Note that \(\herm{\mat M}\) means
      \(\conj{\tran{\mat M}}\), the conjugate of the transpose).

      \(\U(\infty) = \bigcup_n \U(n)\) with the natural inclusion. This is a
      mostly custom definition.
     \item
      \(\SU_n(R)\) is the subgroup of \(\U_n(R)\) of unitary matrices of
      determinant \(1\). The ``special unitary group''.

      \(\SU_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \SU_n(R)\), with the natural inclusion.
     \item
      \(\PO_n(R) = \O_n(R) / (Z_n(R) \cap \O_n(R))\). The ``projective
      orthogonal group''.

      % \(\PO_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \PO_n(R)\).
     \item
      \(\PSO_n(R) = \SO_n(R) / (Z_n(R) \cap \SO_n(R))\). The ``projective
      special orthogonal group''.

      % \(\PSO_\infty(R) = \bigcup_n \PSO_n(R)\).
     \item
      \(\PU(n) = \U(n) / (Z_n(\C) \cap \U(n))\). The ``projective unitary
      group''.

      % \(\PU(\infty) = \bigcup_n \PU(n)\).
     \item
      \(\PSU(n) = \SU(n) / (Z_n(\C) \cap \SU(n)\). The ``projective special
      unitary group''.

      % \(\PSU(\infty) = \bigcup_n \PSU(n)\).
     \item
      If \(G \sgp R^\times\), then \(\RL_n^G(R)\) is the subgroup of
      \(\GL_n(R)\) with determinants in \(G\). This generalises \(\SL\) and
      \(\GL\), since \(\SL_n(R) = \RL_n^{\set 1}(R)\), and

  This question is not supposed to be unpleasantly long and depressing.
  Rather, it is a very pleasant source of interesting sub-questions to think
  about over a long period of time.
  Be advised that this question can be done performing
  fewer direct comparisons than \(\tfrac 12 n(n - 1)\).

  Disclaimer: the authors have not yet produced a full answer to this question,
  and they cannot answer some of this question without the use of some Linear
  Algebra. Particularly, you are well within your right to ignore all the matrix
  groups.
 \item
  If \(A, B, G\) are groups, we say that \(A \dprod B\) is a
  \emph{decomposition} of \(G\) if \(G \isom A \dprod B\), and neither of \(A\)
  and \(B\) is trivial. We say that a group \(G\) is \emph{decomposable} if
  there exists a decomposition of \(G\).

  Which of the following groups are decomposable?
  \begin{multicols}{4}
   \begin{itemize}
    \item
     \(\Z\)
    \item
     \(\Q\)
    \item
     \(\C\)
    \item
     \(\Q^\times\)
    \item
     \(\R^\times\)
    \item
     \(\C^\times\)
    \item
     \(\Q_{>0}^\times\)
    \item
     \(\Q / \Z\)
   \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols}
 \item
  Are there infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic groups of infinite order?

  Are there uncountably many?
 \item
  Let \(G\) be a group, and let \(a, b \in G\). Must \(ab\) have the same order
  as \(ba\)?
 \item
  Here is a strengthening of Cayley's theorem in the case of finite groups.
  \begin{tcolorbox}
   If \(G\) is a group of finite order, then \(G\) is isomorphic to a subgroup
   of \(A_n\) for some \(n\).
  \end{tcolorbox}
  Is it true?
 \item
  Here is a strengthening of the Cantor-Schr\"oder-Bernstein theorem, for
  groups.
  \begin{tcolorbox}
   If \(G\) and \(H\) are groups, and there are injective homomorphisms
   \(\phi: G \to H\) and \(\rho: H \to G\), then \(G \isom H\).
  \end{tcolorbox}
  Is it true?
 \item
  Does \(\R\) have any proper subgroups of finite index?
 \item
  If the Axiom of Choice is assumed, it is a famous result than then every
  vector space has a basis. Particularly, \(\R\) and \(\C\) both have bases as
  \(\Q\)-vector spaces. These bases must have the same cardinality, so in fact
  they induce an isomorphism of additive groups, \(\R \isom \C\).

  Prove that if \(\R \isom \C\), then \(S^1 \isom \C^\times\).

  By assuming further that \(\R \isom \R \dprod \Q\), show that
  \begin{itemize}
   \item
    \(\Q \dprod (\R/\Z) \isom \R \dprod (\Q/\Z) \isom
      \R \dprod (\R/\Z) \isom (\R/\Z)\)
   \item
    \((\R/\Z) \dprod (\Q/\Z) \isom (\R/\Z) \dprod (\R/\Z)\)
   \item
    \(\R/\Q \isom \R\)
    (be careful here! \(A \isom B\) and \(C \isom D\) don't necessarily imply
    \(A/C \isom B/D\))
  \end{itemize}
 \item
  Let \(G_1 \sgp G_2 \sgp G_3 \sgp ...\) be a chain of groups ordered by
  inclusion. Let \(G = \bigcup_n G_n\). Show that \(G\) is a group with the
  natural operation ``given \(a, b \in G\), let \(i\) be such that
  \(a, b \in G_i\). Then \(a \cdot_G b \defeq a \cdot_{G_i} b\)''.

  Show that if each \(G_i\) is simple, then \(G\) is simple.
 \item
  Let \(G\) be a group. Show that the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
   \item
    \(G\) is abelian.
   \item
    The map \(\phi: G \to G, g \mapsto g^{-1}\) is a homomorphism.
   \item
    The map \(\phi: G \to G, g \mapsto g^2\) is a homomorphism.
   \item
    The set \(\Delta = \set{(g, g) \mid g \in G} \subset G \dprod G\) is a
    normal subgroup of \(G \dprod G\).
   \item
    For any \(a, b, n \in \Z\) and any \(g, h \in G\), we have
    \((g^a h^b)^n = g^{an} h^{bn}\) (ie, \(G\) is a \(\Z\)-module).
  \end{enumerate}
 \item
  Find a natural operation \(\ast\) on \(\N\) that is associative, but not
  commutative\footnote{If your answer mentioned the word ``bijection'', go and
  stand in the corner, think about what you've done, and think of an operation
  that is associative and \emph{anticommutative}, ie
  \(a \ast b = b \ast a \iff a = b\)}.
 \item
  A relation \(\le\) on a set \(S\) is a \emph{total order} if
  \begin{itemize}
   \item
    \(\le\) is \emph{antisymmetric}: For all \(a, b \in S\), if \(a \le b\) and
    \(b \le a\), then \(a = b\).
   \item
    \(\le\) is transitive
   \item
    \(\le\) is connex: For all \(a, b \in S\), either
    \(a \le b\) or \(b \le a\).
  \end{itemize}
  Two totally ordered sets \((S, \le)\) and \((T, \preceq)\) are
  \emph{order-isomorphic} if there is a bijection \(\phi: S \to T\) such that
  for all \(s_1, s_2 \in S\),
  \(s_1 \le s_2 \iff \phi(s_1) \preceq \phi(s_2)\).

  Is every countable totally ordered set order-isomorphic to some subset of
  \(\Q\) with the usual \(\le\) on \(\Q\)?

  Is every totally ordered set that injects into \(\R\) order-isomorphic to some
  subset of \(\R\) with the usual \(\le\) on \(\R\)?
 \item
  Is every \(x \in \R\) the root of some nonzero power series with coefficients
  in \(\Q\)?

  Is every \(z \in \C\) the root of some nonzero power series with coefficients
  in \(\Q\)?

  This is a great resource to learn about both how interactive theorem proving
  works (which is likely a big part of the future of maths), and to learn how
  to actually build up from Peano's axioms, which is not completely
  straightforward, despite being boldly skipped by Numbers and Sets.
 \item
  Let \(\vec f_n\) be a sequence of vectors defined by
  \begin{align*}
   \vec f_0 \defeq
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   &&
   \vec f_{n + 1} \defeq
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\vec f_n
  \end{align*}
  Show that
  \(\vec f_{n + 2} = \vec f_{n + 1} + \vec f_n\) for all
  \(n \in \N\), and that \((\vec f_1)_1 = (\vec f_2)_1 = 1\). By
  writing \(\begin{psmallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{psmallmatrix}\) as
  \(\mat U \mat D \mat U^{-1}\) where \(\mat D\) is a diagonal matrix,
  find a closed form for the \(n\)th term of the Fibonacci sequence, without
  resorting to any applied nonsense or guesswork.
